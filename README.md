# Plant Community App

This Plant Community App is a web application that allows users to share information about their plants, read about other users' plants, and use an AI function to identify plants and get relevant information. The app is built using EJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and Passport for authentication.

## Demo

Sorry, there is no demo link available at the moment.

## How It's Made:

Tech used: EJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Passport.

The first step in building this project was to set up the backend using Node.js and Express. MongoDB was used as the database to store user information, plant information, and posts made by users. Passport was implemented to handle user authentication.

Once the backend was set up, the next step was to create the frontend using EJS. The testing UI was designed using CSS and tailwind. The users can create an account, login, and start posting about their plants. The AI function was tested and will be implemented soon

The app allows users to like and delete their posts, view posts made by other users, and search for plants using keywords. Future features could include more advanced AI functions, the ability to comment on posts, and direct messaging between users.

Overall, building this Plant Community App was a great learning experience and allowed me to improve my skills in full-stack web development. It required attention to detail, careful planning, and improved my understanding of Node.js, MongoDB, and authentication using Passport.

## Lessons Learned

AI can add value: The AI function implemented in this app can add value to users by helping them identify plants and providing relevant information. It is important to keep exploring new technologies and ways to improve the user experience.
